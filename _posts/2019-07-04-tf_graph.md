title: Tensorflow graphs in Tensorboard
---

This post demonstrate how setup & access Tensorflow graphs.

---

In order to access Tensorflow graphs, you need to use [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/r2/get_started) which comes will Tensorflow
installed.

The following snippet shows how to setup a ```FileWriter``` with a Tensorflow
graph.

```
tf.reset_default_graph()
sess = tf.Session()

# Your Tensorflow graph goes here.
# ...

sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

# Declare tf.summary.FileWriter where log is your output directory for
# Tensorboard & add the graph to the writer.
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('log', sess.graph)

# Run your training loop
# sess.run(...)

writer.close()
```

Run this command in terminal to start tensorboard:
```
tensorboard --logdir log
```
Navigate to ```http://127.0.0.1:6006``` in your browser to access Tensorflow.
Your graph is in the graph tab.
