Notes on measurement for quantum systems.

# Notation:

The complement is represented by: '

The dot product is represented by: .

The squared of the L2 norm of ψ is represented by: ||ψ||

# Why <ψ|0><0|ψ> = ||a0|0>|| ?

Ans:

<ψ|0><0|ψ> = a0' . a0

|| a0 |0> || = ( a0 |0> )' . ( a0 |0> )

             = ( a0' <0| ) . ( a0 |0> )

             = a0' . a0

Notes on mixed states for quantum systems.

Pure states are kets, bras & density matrices.

ket example: |ψ>

bra example: <ψ|

density matrix example: |ψ><ψ|

Mixed states are classical probability distributions over pure states.

$$\sum_{i} p_{i}|\psi_{i}\rangle\langle\psi_{i}|$$, where $$\sum_{i} p_{i}=1$$, $$p_{i}\geq 0$$

mixed state example: 0.5 (|0><0|) + 0.5 (|1><1|)
