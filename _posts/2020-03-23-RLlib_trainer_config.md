# yapf: disable
# __sphinx_doc_begin__
COMMON_CONFIG = {
    # === Settings for Rollout Worker processes ===
    # Number of rollout worker actors to create for parallel sampling. Setting
    # this to 0 will force rollouts to be done in the trainer actor.
    "num_workers": 2,
    # Number of environments to evaluate vectorwise per worker. This enables
    # model inference batching, which can improve performance for inference
    # bottlenecked workloads.
    "num_envs_per_worker": 1,
    # Divide episodes into fragments of this many steps each during rollouts.
    # Sample batches of this size are collected from rollout workers and
    # combined into a larger batch of `train_batch_size` for learning.
    #
    # For example, given rollout_fragment_length=100 and train_batch_size=1000:
    #   1. RLlib collects 10 fragments of 100 steps each from rollout workers.
    #   2. These fragments are concatenated and we perform an epoch of SGD.
    #
    # When using multiple envs per worker, the fragment size is multiplied by
    # `num_envs_per_worker`. This is since we are collecting steps from
    # multiple envs in parallel. For example, if num_envs_per_worker=5, then
    # rollout workers will return experiences in chunks of 5*100 = 500 steps.
    #
    # The dataflow here can vary per algorithm. For example, PPO further
    # divides the train batch into minibatches for multi-epoch SGD.
    "rollout_fragment_length": 200,
    # Deprecated; renamed to `rollout_fragment_length` in 0.8.4.
    "sample_batch_size": DEPRECATED_VALUE,
    # Whether to rollout "complete_episodes" or "truncate_episodes" to
    # `rollout_fragment_length` length unrolls. Episode truncation guarantees
    # evenly sized batches, but increases variance as the reward-to-go will
    # need to be estimated at truncation boundaries.
    "batch_mode": "truncate_episodes",

    # === Settings for the Trainer process ===
    # Number of GPUs to allocate to the trainer process. Note that not all
    # algorithms can take advantage of trainer GPUs. This can be fractional
    # (e.g., 0.3 GPUs).
    "num_gpus": 0,
    # Training batch size, if applicable. Should be >= rollout_fragment_length.
    # Samples batches will be concatenated together to a batch of this size,
    # which is then passed to SGD.

    # Arguments to pass to the policy model. See models/catalog.py for a full
    # list of the available model options.
    "model": MODEL_DEFAULTS,

    "optimizer": {},

    # === Environment Settings ===
    # Discount factor of the MDP.
    "gamma": 0.99,
    # Number of steps after which the episode is forced to terminate. Defaults
    # to `env.spec.max_episode_steps` (if present) for Gym envs.
    "horizon": None,
    # Calculate rewards but don't reset the environment when the horizon is
    # hit. This allows value estimation and RNN state to span across logical
    # episodes denoted by horizon. This only has an effect if horizon != inf.
    "soft_horizon": False,
    # Don't set 'done' at the end of the episode. Note that you still need to
    # set this if soft_horizon=True, unless your env is actually running
    # forever without returning done=True.
    "no_done_at_end": False,
    # Arguments to pass to the env creator.
    "env_config": {},
    # Environment name can also be passed via config.
    "env": None,
    # Unsquash actions to the upper and lower bounds of env's action space
    "normalize_actions": False,
    # Whether to clip rewards prior to experience postprocessing. Setting to
    # None means clip for Atari only.
    "clip_rewards": None,
    # Whether to np.clip() actions to the action space low/high range spec.
    "clip_actions": True,
    # Whether to use rllib or deepmind preprocessors by default
    "preprocessor_pref": "deepmind",
    # The default learning rate.
    "lr": 0.0001,

    # === Debug Settings ===
    # Whether to write episode stats and videos to the agent log dir. This is
    # typically located in ~/ray_results.
    "monitor": False,
    # Set the ray.rllib.* log level for the agent process and its workers.
    # Should be one of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, or ERROR. The DEBUG level will also
    # periodically print out summaries of relevant internal dataflow (this is
    # also printed out once at startup at the INFO level). When using the
    # `rllib train` command, you can also use the `-v` and `-vv` flags as
    # shorthand for INFO and DEBUG.
    "log_level": "WARN",
    # Callbacks that will be run during various phases of training. These all
    # take a single "info" dict as an argument. For episode callbacks, custom
    # metrics can be attached to the episode by updating the episode object's
    # custom metrics dict (see examples/custom_metrics_and_callbacks.py). You
    # may also mutate the passed in batch data in your callback.

    # of currently healthy workers is reported as the "num_healthy_workers"
    # metric.

    # Log system resource metrics to results. This requires `psutil` to be
    # installed for sys stats, and `gputil` for GPU metrics.
    "log_sys_usage": True,

    # === Framework Settings ===
    # Use PyTorch (instead of tf). If using `rllib train`, this can also be
    # enabled with the `--torch` flag.
    # NOTE: Some agents may not support `torch` yet and throw an error.
    "use_pytorch": False,

    # Enable TF eager execution (TF policies only). If using `rllib train`,
    # this can also be enabled with the `--eager` flag.
    "eager": False,
    # Enable tracing in eager mode. This greatly improves performance, but
    # makes it slightly harder to debug since Python code won't be evaluated
    # after the initial eager pass.
    "eager_tracing": False,
    # Disable eager execution on workers (but allow it on the driver). This
    # only has an effect if eager is enabled.
    "no_eager_on_workers": False,

    # === Exploration Settings ===
    # Default exploration behavior, iff `explore`=None is passed into
    # compute_action(s).

    # === Evaluation Settings ===
    # Evaluate with every `evaluation_interval` training iterations.

    # metrics are already only reported for the lowest epsilon workers.

    "in_evaluation": False,
    # Typical usage is to pass extra args to evaluation env creator
    # and to disable exploration by computing deterministic actions.
    # IMPORTANT NOTE: Policy gradient algorithms are able to find the optimal

        # "explore": False
    },
    # Number of parallel workers to use for evaluation. Note that this is set
    # to zero by default, which means evaluation will be run in the trainer

    # of the trainer since evaluation workers are created separately from
    # rollout workers.
    "evaluation_num_workers": 0,
    # Customize the evaluation method. This must be a function of signature
    # (trainer: Trainer, eval_workers: WorkerSet) -> metrics: dict. See the
    # Trainer._evaluate() method to see the default implementation. The
    # trainer guarantees all eval workers have the latest policy state before

    # be enabled by setting RLLIB_EXEC_API=1.
    "use_exec_api": False,

    # === Advanced Rollout Settings ===
    # Use a background thread for sampling (slightly off-policy, usually not

    "metrics_smoothing_episodes": 100,
    # If using num_envs_per_worker > 1, whether to create those new envs in
    # remote processes instead of in the same worker. This adds overheads, but
    # can make sense if your envs can take much time to step / reset
    # (e.g., for StarCraft). Use this cautiously; overheads are significant.
    "remote_worker_envs": False,
    # Timeout that remote workers are waiting when polling environments.
    # 0 (continue when at least one env is ready) is a reasonable default,

    # Minimum time per train iteration (frequency of metrics reporting).

    # === Advanced Resource Settings ===
    # Number of CPUs to allocate per worker.
    "num_cpus_per_worker": 1,
    # Number of GPUs to allocate per worker. This can be fractional. This is
    # usually needed only if your env itself requires a GPU (i.e., it is a
    # GPU-intensive video game), or model inference is unusually expensive.

    # Any custom Ray resources to allocate per worker.

    "num_cpus_for_driver": 1,
    # You can set these memory quotas to tell Ray to reserve memory for your
    # training run. This guarantees predictable execution, but the tradeoff is
    # if your workload exceeeds the memory quota it will fail.

    # can be large if your are using large train batches, replay buffers, etc.
    "memory": 0,

    #  - "simulation": run the environment in the background, but use
    #    this data for evaluation only and not for learning.
    "input_evaluation": ["is", "wis"],
    # Whether to run postprocess_trajectory() on the trajectory fragments from

    # on-policy algorithms.
    "postprocess_inputs": False,
    # If positive, input batches will be shuffled via a sliding window buffer
    # of this number of batches. Use this if the input data is not in random
    # enough order. Input is delayed until the shuffle buffer is filled.
    "shuffle_buffer_size": 0,
    # Specify where experiences should be saved:
    #  - None: don't save any experiences
